# Stroke_Detection_Using_Retinal_Fundus_Images_By_Deep_Learning
This project focuses on detecting potential signs of stroke through the analysis of retinal fundus images using deep learning techniques. It combines vessel segmentation, feature extraction, and narrowing classification to evaluate stroke risk.
